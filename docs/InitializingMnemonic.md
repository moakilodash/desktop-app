# Initializing with Mnemonic Backup

[‚Üê Back to Documentation](README.md)

Backing up your wallet is crucial. The app will generate a mnemonic phrase (a series of words) that acts as a backup.

1. **Generate Mnemonic**: The app will display a 12-word mnemonic phrase.
2. **Save the Mnemonic**: Write down the phrase on paper or a secure medium. Do not store it digitally if possible.
3. **Confirm Mnemonic**: The app will prompt you to confirm the words to verify you've saved it correctly.
